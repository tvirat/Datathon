# Datathon
**Here is an update on our current discussion. Those are our two final goals for this Datathon:**
1. **EDA and Visualizations:** Summarize and visualize key patterns in the dataset. Conclude key business insights from them. (e.g. key delay hotspots, correlations between different factors, etc.) Present the result in our final markdown file.
2. **THE MAJOR TASK!!!** Develop a model to forecast TTC delays. Kinda like the weather forecast, inputs a starting point, a destination, and the time (possibly other fields as well), output the probability that there is going to be a delay and locations of delay.
Hopefully develop a website for this use case.
